THE TEA GAME (Tradition, Entertainment, and Affection) is a dynamic and fun game that requires luck and strategy. A greedy strategy with too many Jacks can ruin everything, while a timid one may form too few pairs. Ties are common, and it takes a few rounds to draw a Diamonds card. Minimum 3 rounds, maximum indefinite. Maximum 4 pairs per round.
