===========================================

- Time: 10 to 30 minutes.
- Players: 2.
- Age: from  12 years old.  (For minors,
  it is recommended  to replace the term
  "lover" with "thief").

INTRODUCTION
============

THE   CHA  GAME   (Culture,  Humor   and
Affection)  is  an  easy-to-learn,  fun,
quick, and dynamic  game that involves a
bit  of   luck  and  strategy.   It  has
characteristics  of  the game  "21,"  in
which  a new  blind  card  can imply  an
improvement or worsening  of the current
cards.  A   greedy  strategy   can  ruin
everything  with  too many  Js  (Jacks),
just as an overly timid strategy can end
up forming few couples.

The  chance of  a tie  in each  round is
relatively high  according to  the tests
performed, and  it takes  several rounds
for a Diamond card  to be purchased. The
minimum number  of rounds is 3,  and the
maximum is  undefined, depending  on how
many result in a tie.

The maximum number  of couples formed in
a  round is  4,  although  it is  highly
unlikely  that  none  of  them  will  be
blocked.

MATERIAL
========

- Face cards of all suits:
  Q, J, K.

- Diamond suit cards from Ace to 7:
  A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of Diamonds.

- JOKER.

SYMBOLISM
=========

K (King) = Husband.
Q (Queen) = Wife.
J (Jack) = Lover (or "Thief").
JOKER = Clown / Humor.

Suits:

Diamonds = Money.
Clubs = Culture.
Hearts = Love.
Spades = Fury.


1. OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME
========================

1.1 The objective of  the game is to end
up  with more  "diamonds."  The  A (Ace)
card  is worth  1 point,  the 2  card is
worth 2,  and so on,  up to 7. So,  if a
player ends up  with the 3, 4,  and 7 of
Diamonds, they score 14 points.

See also Chapter 6. END OF THE GAME.


2. PREPARATION
==============

2.1  Shuffle and  form a  pile with  the
face  cards and  the  JOKER, called  the
"main pile."

2.2 Shuffle  and form another  pile with
the  Diamond numbered  cards. This  pile
represents the "treasure chest."

2.3  In  the  first  play,  each  player
receives two  cards from the  main pile,
which can be any face  card (Q, J, K, or
JOKER). At  this first moment,  only the
player can  see their own  cards without
revealing them to the opponent.

2.4 The youngest player starts.


3. ROUND
========

3.1 The  objective of  each round  is to
accumulate more  valid couples (K  + Q),
according to  the conditions  defined in
Chapter 4. REVELATION.

3.2 On  the current player's  turn, they
analyze their hand and choose to stop or
draw another  card.  If they  stop, they
must keep  the same cards in  their hand
until the cards are revealed.

3.3 If the  opponent player has stopped,
the current player  can continue to draw
cards indefinitely or  until they choose
to stop.

3.4 When  both players have  stopped, it
is  time for  REVELATION.  All cards  in
hand  must be  placed on  the table  and
revealed.

3.5  If there  are no  more cards  to be
drawn  from the  "main pile,"  the round
goes to the REVELATION phase (Chapter 4)
by default.


4. REVELATION
=============

4.1   First,   all   couples   must   be
formed. Couples are a set of one K (King
/   husband)   and   one  Q   (Queen   /
wife).  Keep couples  of  the same  suit
together, when possible,  because of the
SPECIAL COMBINATIONS (Chapter 5).

4.2  Second, each  J (Jack  / lover)  in
hand  will  "cancel"  a  couple  in  the
user's hand. This  couple will no longer
be valid when counting couples.

4.3  At  this  point, any  remaining  Js
(Jacks / lovers) can be used to "cancel"
the opponent's  couples, except  if both
the K and  Q of the couple  are from the
suit  of  Hearts  (loving  couple),  see
SPECIAL COMBINATIONS (Chapter 5.1).

4.4  If  after  the previous  steps,  at
least one  J (Jack  / lover)  remains in
the player's hand,  the player loses the
round. If  both players end up  with one
J, there is a tie in the round.

4.5  The player  who ends  up with  more
couples  (not canceled)  than the  other
wins the  round. If  the players  end up
with  equal  numbers  of  valid  couples
(example: 0  to 0, 1  to 1, or 2  to 2),
there is a tie in the round.

4.6 The JOKER (Clown,  the humor) can be
used  to remove  a J  from the  player's
hand (distraction). For  example, it can
be used to remove  a J that is canceling
a couple  in their hand  or a J  that is
left over (which  could cause the player
to  lose  the  round according  to  item
4.4).  The  JOKER  can  also  remove  an
"intrusive lover," meaning  a J from the
opponent that  is canceling one  of your
couples.

4.7 The  player who  wins the  round can
buy  a card  from  the "treasure  chest"
(pile with  Diamond numbered  cards). If
the  player has  a  "rich couple"  where
both  K  and  Q  are from  the  suit  of
Diamonds,  then the  player can  buy two
cards, see SPECIAL COMBINATIONS (Chapter
5.2). This card  must be accumulated and
stored in  a separate  pile next  to the
player, as it will be used later for the
final   count  (see   6.   END  OF   THE
GAME).  This  card  must be  visible  to
everyone, as everyone  should be able to
verify  the  final game  condition  (see
Chapter 6. END OF THE GAME).

4.8 In the  case of a tie  in the round,
no one  buys a  card from  the "treasure
chest" pile.

4.9  After the  end  of  the round,  the
cards should be shuffled and returned to
the "main pile."


5. SPECIAL COMBINATIONS
=======================

Combinations  are couples  (K+Q) of  the
same suit. The  superpower is only valid
if  the couple  is not  "canceled" by  a
J. Powers  can also  only be  applied at
the time  of REVELATION (Chapter  4) and
never before.

5.1 "Loving couple"  (two Hearts) cannot
be canceled by a J (Jack / lover).

5.2 "Rich couple"  (two Diamonds) allows
the player  to buy two Diamond  cards if
they win the round.

5.3  "Cultured couple"  (two Clubs)  has
the right  to buy more cards  even after
the  revelation.   After  revealing  the
cards, the player with a  K and J of the
Clubs suit can buy as many cards as they
want to try to reverse the round if they
are losing.  Remember that if  the round
is tied, buying more  cards can create a
risk  of  losing  the round  due  to  an
excess of Js (Jacks / lovers).

5.4 "Valiant couple" (two Spades) steals
the  JOKER (Clown,  the humor)  from the
opponent  and can  use it  in their  own
hand  to remove  an unwanted  J (Jack  /
lover).


6. END OF THE GAME
==================

The game  ends when  a player  reaches a
sum of  at least 15 points,  as it would
be impossible  to reverse  the situation
(A+2+3+4+5+6+7 = 28).

It is possible to create game variations
with  fewer   cards  in   the  "treasure
chest."  This way,  the  game would  end
more quickly. If doing this, always keep
the  smaller cards,  for example:  A, 2,
and  3.  The  total   sum  would  be  6;
therefore,  whoever reaches  at least  4
points would win the game.

If the cards in the "treasure chest" run
out and there is  a tie (for example, 14
x 14 or  3 x 3), an extra  round must be
started to decide the final winner.
